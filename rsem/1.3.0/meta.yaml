  notes: >
    The pRSEM component is *NOT* functional out of the box. It requires the
    UCSC `bigWigSummary` application, which we cannot re-distribute due to
    licensing restrictions. To get pRSEM working, you must first download
    `bigWigSummary` for your platform (x86_64 OS X or x86_64 Linux) from
    <http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/> and install it into the correct
    conda environment's (e.g., BioBuilds) "bin" directory. WARNING: you, the
    end user, accept responsibility for being compliant with the UCSC Genome
    Browser utilities license, as described in the "Source & Utilities
    Downloads" section of <http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>.
