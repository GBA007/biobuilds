BioBuilds is a curated collection of open-source bioinformatics tools,
pre-built for Linux on both Intel x86_64 and IBM POWER8 systems as well as
Mac OS X. It builds on Continuum Analytics' [(mini)conda
system](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) to help deliver
reproducible, versioned environments that conveniently also largely
eliminates dependency hell.
