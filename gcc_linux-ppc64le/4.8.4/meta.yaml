  summary: GNU C compiler (activation scripts)
  description: |
    Shim that enables the `compiler('c')` Jinja function in conda recipes on
    the Linux on POWER (linux-ppc64le) platform. Note that unlike its x86_64
    equivalent, this package does _not_ actually install the GNU C compiler
    (gcc); instead, it just ensures `gcc` and its associated binaries/links are
    installed in `/usr/bin`.
