# Package: digest
# Version: 0.6.8
# Date: 2013-12-30
# Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> with contributions  by Antoine Lucas, Jarek Tuszynski, Henrik Bengtsson, Simon Urbanek, Mario Frasca, Bryan Lewis, Murray Stokely, Hannes Muehleisen, Duncan Murdoch, Jim Hester and Wush Wu.

# Title: Create Cryptographic Hash Digests of R Objects
# Description: Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation  of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256,  crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message authentication code. . The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1  and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2,  and the crc32 algorithm is described in  ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. . For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron D. Gifford is used. For xxHash, the implementation by Yann Collet is used. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. . Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for  cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely  tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
