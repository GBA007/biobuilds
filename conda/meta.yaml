  # WARNING: This recipe is provided only as a stop-gap until the "defaults"
  # channel picks up conda updates for the linux-ppc64le platform. It should
  # NOT be used to build conda packages for other platforms; those users should
  # rely on Continuum's "defaults" channel instead!
  skip: True  # [not ppc64le]

  # These are present when the new environment is created
  # so we have to exempt them from the list of initial files
  # for conda-build to realize they should be included.
