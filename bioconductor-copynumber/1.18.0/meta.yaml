  summary: Segmentation of single- and multi-track copy number data by penalized least squares regression
  description: |
    Penalized least squares regression is applied to fit piecewise constant
    curves to copy number data to locate genomic regions of constant copy
    number. Procedures are available for individual segmentation of each
    sample, joint segmentation of several samples and joint segmentation of the
    two data tracks from SNP-arrays. Several plotting functions are available
    for visualization of the data and the segmentation results.
