build:
  # Skipping OS X build for now because Perl::Tk seem insistent on using its
  # own Tk sources, rather than using the "system" Tk libraries. Said Tk
  # sources require X11 support to build correctly, but we currently haven't
  # come up with a great way of distributing X11 runtime libraries on OS X at
  # the moment (trying to avoid having users install XQuartz).
