DNA parsimony algorithm, version 3.6b

Setting for this run:
  U                 Search for best tree?  Yes
  S                        Search option?  More thorough search
  V              Number of trees to save?  10000
  J   Randomize input order of sequences?  No. Use input order
  O                        Outgroup root?  No, use as outgroup species  1
  T              Use Threshold parsimony?  No, use ordinary parsimony
  N           Use Transversion parsimony?  No, count all steps
  W                       Sites weighted?  No
  M           Analyze multiple data sets?  No
  I          Input sequences interleaved?  Yes
  0   Terminal type (IBM PC, ANSI, none)?  (none)
  1    Print out the data at start of run  No
  2  Print indications of progress of run  Yes
  3                        Print out tree  Yes
  4          Print out steps in each site  No
  5  Print sequences at all nodes of tree  No
  6       Write out trees onto tree file?  Yes

  Y to accept these or type the letter for one to change
