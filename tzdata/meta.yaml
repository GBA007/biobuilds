        The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and
        data that represent the history of local time for many representative
        locations around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect
        changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets,
        and daylight-saving rules. Its management procedure is documented in
        "BCP 175: Procedures for Maintaining the Time Zone Database".
