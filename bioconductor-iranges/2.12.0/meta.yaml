  summary: "Infrastructure for manipulating intervals on sequences"
  description: |
    Provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes for storing,
    manipulating and aggregating over annotated ranges of integers. Implements
    an algebra of range operations, including efficient algorithms for finding
    overlaps and nearest neighbors. Defines efficient list-like classes for
    storing, transforming and aggregating large grouped data, i.e., collections
    of atomic vectors and DataFrames.
