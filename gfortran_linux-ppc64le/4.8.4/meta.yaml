  summary: GNU Fortran compiler (activation scripts)
  description: |
    Shim that enables the `compiler('fortran')` Jinja function in conda recipes
    on the Linux on POWER (linux-ppc64le) platform. Note that unlike its x86_64
    equivalent, this package does _not_ actually install the GNU Fortran
    compiler (gfortran); instead, it just ensures `gfortran` and its associated
    symlinks are installed in `/usr/bin`.
