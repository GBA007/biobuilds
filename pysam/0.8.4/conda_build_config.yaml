# ** NOTE **: This version of pysam is incompatible with htslib >=1.4 (triggers
# conflicting type errors for 'errmod_*' in samtools/errmod.h). We're due for a
# pysam upgrade, so instead of putting the effort into patching this version to
# work with htslib >=1.4, we'll just statically link a compatible libhts. That
# way, we can still use this version of pysam in newer BioBuilds environments.
htslib:
  - 1.3.2
  #- 1.6.0

# Use older zlib version to maintain backwards compatibilty with previous
# BioBuilds releases.
zlib:
  - 1.2.8

# See above for why we are not pinning htslib.
