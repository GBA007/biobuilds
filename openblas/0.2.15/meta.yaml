    # Needed to get "DYNAMIC_ARCH=1" building correctly on some VMs;
    # specifically, our OS X 10.9 build VMs seem to always identify their CPU
    # microarchitecture as "Penryn", even when the VM host has a CPU with a
    # more recent microarchitecture. However, since we can pass-through and use
    # newer (e.g., SSE4.2 or AVX) instructions, expose this value in the conda
    # build environment so the "dynamic arch" library can be properly tested.
    # (Without it, "make tests" will likely fail with an "Architecture
    # Initilization failed" error when building inside an OS X VM.)
