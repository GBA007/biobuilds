#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The original CRAN metadata for this package was:

# Package: Rcpp
# Title: Seamless R and C++ Integration
# Version: 0.12.2
# Date: 2015-11-14
# Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel, Romain Francois, JJ Allaire, Kevin Ushey,  Qiang Kou, Douglas Bates and John Chambers
# Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
# Description: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing of new code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation  about 'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package, via the  'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper by Eddelbuettel and  Francois (2011, JSS), and the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer); see  'citation("Rcpp")' for details on these last two.
