package:
  name: boost
  version: "1.62.0"

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    # Boost's dynamic libraries record the specific version of the ICU
    # libraries they were linked against, so specify the version here so
    # things don't get confused and break at runtime.
    #
    # Match the ICU version used by the Qt 5 (if one exists for the platform),
    # so trying to install this along with Qt 5-dependent packages (e.g.,
    # matplotlib) doesn't end up creating an unresolvable dependency graph.
