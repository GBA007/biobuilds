  summary: GNU C++ compiler (activation scripts)
  description: |
    Shim that enables the `compiler('c++')` Jinja function in conda recipes on
    the Linux on POWER (linux-ppc64le) platform. Note that unlike its x86_64
    equivalent, this package does _not_ actually install the GNU C++ compiler
    (g++); instead, it just ensures `g++` and its associated symlinks are
    installed in `/usr/bin`.
