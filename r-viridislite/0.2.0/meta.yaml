  summary: Default Color Maps from 'matplotlib' (Lite Version)
  description: |
    Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -,
    'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib' is a popular plotting
    library for 'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they
    will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form
    and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to be
    perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness. This is
    the 'lite' version of the more complete 'viridis' package that can be found
    at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
