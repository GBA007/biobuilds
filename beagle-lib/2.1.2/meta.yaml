requirements:
  # Notes:
  # * OS X: gcc/libgcc needed for OpenMP support. autoconf/automake needed
  #   since these aren't supplied by Xcode. (GNU) libtool needed since the
  #   Xcode version doesn't play nice with the configure.ac provided.
  # * Linux on x86_64: autoconf/automake needed since CentOS 6 packages are too
  #   old to process the provided configure.ac. (GNU) libtool needed since the
  #   CentOS 6 version doesn't play nice with these autoconf/automake releases;
  #   note that we don't need the libtool runtime on Linux as the resuling
  #   shared libraries (.so files) link to libdl.so instead of libtldl.so.
