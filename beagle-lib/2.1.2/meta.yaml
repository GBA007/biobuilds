  patches:
    - update-build-system.patch
    - disable-cpu-extensions.patch  # [not ppc64le]
    - ppc64le-support.patch         # [ppc64le]

requirements:
  # Notes:
  # * OS X: gcc/libgcc needed for OpenMP support. autoconf/automake needed
  #   since these aren't supplied by Xcode. (GNU) libtool needed since the
  #   Xcode version doesn't play nice with the configure.ac provided.
  # * Linux on x86_64: autoconf/automake needed since CentOS 6 packages are too
  #   old to process the provided configure.ac. (GNU) libtool needed since the
  #   CentOS 6 version doesn't play nice with these autoconf/automake releases.
  #   We use them on ppc64le simply to be consistent across architectures.
  # * libtool also needed at runtime to provide libtldl.{so,dylib}.
