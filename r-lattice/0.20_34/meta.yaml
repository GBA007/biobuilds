# The original CRAN metadata for this package was:

# Package: lattice
# Version: 0.20-34
# Date: 2016-09-06
# Priority: recommended
# Title: Trellis Graphics for R
# Author: Deepayan Sarkar <deepayan.sarkar@r-project.org>
# Maintainer: Deepayan Sarkar <deepayan.sarkar@r-project.org>
# Description: A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements. See ?Lattice for an introduction.
