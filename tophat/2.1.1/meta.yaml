package:
  name: tophat
  version: "2.1.1"

requirements:
  build:
    - biobuilds-build
    - autoconf-update
    - zlib
    # AT (which we use to build ppc64le packages with the "opt" feature) comes
    # with its own set of pre-built Boost runtime libraries, so use those
    # rather than the ones provided by the BioBuilds "boost" package. Avoids
    # potential runtime problems, since AT-generated binaries include the AT
    # "lib64" directory in their RPATH, and we're not 100% sure the libraries
    # from the two Boost packages are compatible.
    - boost 1.62.0      # [not (opt and ppc64le)]
    - python
  run:
    - biobuilds-opt     # [opt]
    - zlib
    # See the "build" section for why this selector for Boost is here.

  no_link:
    # This script relies on readlink(1) to set PATH to the "tophat" binary;
    # force a copy into the install environment to prevent symlinks from
    # "confusing" readlink(1) and causing an bogus python interpreter from
    # being used. (Fixes <https://github.com/lab7/biobuilds/issues/8>)
