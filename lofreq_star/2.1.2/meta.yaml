requirements:
  # Specifically need samtools 1.2 when building because htslib/samtools 1.3
  # triggers this build error: <https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq/issues/28>.
  #
  # However, we should be able to run with any later version of samtools since
  # libhts and libbam are statically linked into the lofreq binary, so all that
  # matters is that the "samtools" command accepts the same CLI arguments.
