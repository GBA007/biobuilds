  summary: "S4 implementation of vectors and lists"
  description: |
    The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and a set
    of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists
    in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like
    objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few
    low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, and
    Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors package itself (many more are
    implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor infrastructure
    packages).
